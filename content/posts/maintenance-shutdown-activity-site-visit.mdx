Hi peeps! I want to share a little bit of my previous experience of a visit to one of my friends' on-site maintenance shutdown activity. My friend was working as an engineer for an M&E (Mechanical & Electrical) Services company. As far as I know, their company focuses on building maintenance services.

Firstly, let me give you a bit of introduction for this area of engineering work in laymen term. The power plant generated the power and supply it via main transmission line at mind-bogglingly high voltage. Once this voltage supply arrives in the building, it needs to be step down according to their type of building (ie factory and residential area have different rated voltage).

There is a control room to manage this power supply which needs both mechanical and electrical expertise. My friend's work on this is to maintain and make sure it will always operating as per normal on the day. In order to execute the maintenance activity, they have to literally turn off the power supply for the whole building of 50 floors plus. They will not be able to do this on the day when there are peoples working in their offices, so when? The answer is the in the middle of the night from 12:00 AM to 4:00 AM or more. This is the time that they put their hard works so that people like you and me can have fun shopping in KLCC on the day.

There are so many reasons for this maintenance shutdown activity to be conducted from a relatively straight forward scheduled parts replacement to solving power supply issue that may take longer time. It was a good experience to be there and have a look at their engineering. I tried to search for some pain points that may exist in their current process that may be solved with an innovative solution.

The pictures below show some activities conducted and can give you some general idea of the operation and work location.

On top of skills and experience, safety is the most important in this engineering. A wrong rewiring may cause your life which is why they have standardized operation to execute this work. This is also the reason why only competent technician can work on this and they need to have certificate such A0 & B4 to name a few.

So, the next time you went shopping, be grateful and thankful :)

I love engineering so much that whenever curiosity hit me, I couldn't help myself but see it with my real eyes, experience it, get the feel of it and as always, the most important - LEARN from it! It is never a waste to learn new knowledge.

I have always wanted to share the details of my previous engineering projects/ assignments with a hope that it will somehow be able to benefit some students out there, by least as a reference and guideline.

For a consumer, a Sim card is only for SMS, phone calls, and the internet. A Sim card on its own is just a piece of metal strip and plastic plate but when it's inside a GSM module, it became a very reliable communication tools. GSM stands for Global System for Mobile, a system to transfer data (be it in a form of voice, video or text) through long range radio wave that transfers from 1 telco tower to another. Unknown to many, besides sending and receiving data, a GSM able to determine the location of your phone. the location of the GSM can be determined by a process called Triangulation. This is the same method used by GPS to narrow down the location determination from 30m radius down to 1m ~ 3m radius.

Having said that, this project that I am about to share does not include the location determination though. I can share about that in one of next posts.

The main components showed above are GSM modular system to detect water leakage at toilet cistern automatically. A water sensor (made of 2 copper wires) is connected to the Input pins on the GSM module.

When the toilet cistern has water leakage, the water sensor under the cistern will detect and send a signal to the GSM module. The GSM module was programmed on Arduino Uno MCU (Microcontroller Unit) to give a phone call and SMS text to the repairer automatically so that the repair action can be taken in time.

{/* For your information, the toilet cistern design in the picture above was designed by senior and won an innovative award. */}

You can create the state in the ParentComponent using `useState` and pass down the `setIsParentData` function as prop into the ChildComponent.

In the ChildComponent, update the data using the received function through prop to send the data back to ParentComponent.

I use this technique especially when my code in the ParentComponent is getting too long, therefore I will create child components from the ParentComponent. Typically, it will be only 1 level down and using useContext or redux seems overkill in order to share states between components.

`ParentComponent.js`

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

export function ParentComponent(){
  const [isParentData, setIsParentData] = useState(True);

  return (
    <p>is this a parent data?: {isParentData}</p>
    <ChildComponent toChild={isParentData} sendToParent={setIsParentData} />
  );
}
```

`ChildComponent.js`

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export function ChildComponent(props){

  return (
    <button onClick={() => {props.sendToParent(False)}}>Update</button>
    <p>The state of isParentData is {props.toChild}</p>
  );
};
```

## About me

I am currently looking for a full-time software engineer role. I considered myself as a fullstack software engineer with focus on frontend development. Given my recent experience, I will be great fit for a mid-level software engineer role.

I am currently on H1-B visa, therefore I do need a company to sponsor H1-B visa transfer for me.

## Where am I?

I'm currently based in the city of San Francisco. Despite it's flaws, I like the city, it's a beautiful city filled with ambitious people building new things.
I am open to work fully on-site, hybrid or fully remote. I'm also open for relocation.

## What I'm working on currently?

1. Building side projects to continuously improve my development skills and speed.
2. Keeping myself updated with AI news and trying it out for myself.
3. Reading/studying DDIA (Designing Data-Intensive Applications).

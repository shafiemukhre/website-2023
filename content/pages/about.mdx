Hey there, my internet friends :)

I'm Shafie, an aspiring craftsman, a fullstack developer with a passion for building useful products with great UX and high performance! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥

I considered myself as a fullstack software engineer with focus on frontend development. I enjoy working across the technology stacks throughout the software development lifecycle from concept, design, development, production to maintenance. I mainly use React with TypeScript for frontend development while for backend development I recently use Java, Python and a bit of Golang.

## What kind of stuff do you find here?

In the spirit of 'learning in public', I'm trying to write more technical contents here basically on all technical and engineering knowledge that I have learned from time to time on Web Dev, Distributed System and Generative AI. Probably in not-so-far future, I will also write on mechanical engineering, robotics and other technical discpline that fascinated me.
